It does this by performing sentiment analysis through various social media platforms. This seems to be a step in the right direction, but it also did consist of many incorrect predictions. This may be because the analysis took into account both fan and critic responses.

On the other hand, it may also demonstrate how there are stark contrasts between ciric and fan receptions.

    "Our hypothesis is that a movieâ€™s likelihood of winning an award is tied to its budget. If we can tie the amount of fiscal investment to the award chance, then our contribution to the overall topic domain can be provided as a predictor for future winners. We can predict what people will think of a movie based on its budget and financial success, and use that to predict future outcomes for movies in the future.\n",

    "However, if our hypotheses doesnâ€™t work out, we can try to find some other correlations that relate to the award chance or other factors that tie into the moviesâ€™ budgets. For example, we can look at how well received the movies were by critics versus by fans and see if there is a relation between movie success based upon critics and fans agreeing or disagreeing. We may also see a trend between how much marketing is done to promote films and how successful those films become. We could also look at how likely movies are to succeed by the success of the cast and crew involved in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major factor that is hard for our data to account for is the change of preferences over time. Critics could get tired of a certain aspect of movies that once yielded success. Furthermore, cultures around the world are constantly changing. It is difficult to quantify \"culture\" and apply that to our analysis without arbitrarily labeling periods of culture."
