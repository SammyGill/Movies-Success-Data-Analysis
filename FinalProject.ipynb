At the end of each movie season there are also a series of awards shows the honor the successes of various films released throughout the year. Our goal in this analysis is to see if there are any observable characteristics of movies that allow us to predict their financial and critical success. We define financial success as the amount of revenue a movie earns and its critical success as its ratings. After this is done, we will also see if we can somehow analyze these characteristics to determine if we can predict the awards given out at the Oscars. This will be done using a Random Forst machine learning algorithm.\n",

However, we also predict that this will not be the case with the movie's ratings, because it most likely takes more than these observable characteristics to determine its rating. With the same reasoning, we also believe it will be difficult to create a machine learning model that predicts the oscars."

Lupo is actually a man; he was coded wrong in the dataset because his name is usually considered a woman's name in the U.S. You might notice that many of the names on this list do not look western. There are only two Americans on this list, Mira Nair and Martha Coolidge. This suggests that other countries have done a better job of supporting women in leadership roles in the moviemaking industry. In particular, half of these women are French.  I would like to do further research on why France has so many female filmmakers but that is for another project. I did find an article on this subject which can be seen here: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/24/france-women-directors"
